[NYC Citibike Data](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/joseph.worland/viz/NYCBike_16229199530930/NYCBikeStory)

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to gather information on the New York City Citibike program. We are interested in bringing a similar program to our city of Des Moines, Iowa. We wanted to see what correlations we could find between different data we collected.

## Results
The results arenâ€™t exactly surprising. More males than any other gender were bike users and the popular times for rides were around business hours. Looks like most people use the bikes as part of their commute to and from locations. You can see this evidence in the map layout of starting and ending locations as well as the bar charts of starting and ending station names. Also looks like most trips are less than an hour in duration. 

I think the most surprising bit of information I gleaned from the Citibike data was that there are drastically more subscribers than customers. Perhaps it is due to NYC being more of a commuter city or maybe Citibike offers great incentive programs for people to be subscribers instead of just customers. It would be good to get more information on both to better inform us on how to structure our program in Des Moines.

## Summary
Overall, I think it is worth it to continue to do research on bringing this program to Des Moines. I think there is plenty of evidence that points to a profitable program that can also impact the environment of Des Moines for the better. Two other potential visualizations that would be useful is concurrent trips so we will have an idea of how many bikes to have available and a visualization that shows the bike id per starting and ending location. The second visualization would be useful to see if more bikes are returned where needed or if redistribution of bikes is needed.
